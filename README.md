## About This Project

This portfolio was built from the ground up to be a clean, fast, and professional representation of my work. It demonstrates a strong understanding of modern web development practices, from architecture and styling to deployment and continuous integration.

The design philosophy is **"architectural and versatile,"** reflecting my ability to work on both foundational systems and modern cloud applications.

## Key Features

- **Component-Based Architecture:** Built with reusable components for the Header, Footer, and Project Cards.
- **Sophisticated Animations:** Uses Framer Motion for smooth page transitions, creating a polished user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** (We will add this feature next)
- **Professional Tooling:** Uses TypeScript for type safety and ESLint for code quality.
- **CI/CD:** Deployed on Vercel with automatic builds triggered by pushes to the `main` branch.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** CSS Modules (No frameworks)
- **Animations:** Framer Motion
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
